TODO:

- non-editable columns and grid focus management
- decide where static/numeric columns are managed
- column widths
- decide on column state - where is it kept
- style Autocomplete properly

WISHLIST:
- add Checkbox editor (?)
- decide on extra row
- maybe make row template static?
- figure out border processing - maybe own AutoSizer based on client{Height, Width}


DONE:
- change the editor API to handle onBlur properly
- handle header rows
- add Autocomplete editor
- handle add new row
- decide what to do with height calculation
- refactor editors
- make focused border look better
